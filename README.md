# Blog Project

## Purpose

This project is a blog project created using my EJS and frontend knowledge on my way to learn Javascript. I built the backend side of the project with Node.js. On the frontend side, I created dynamic websites using EJS. The blog site has a home page, the ability to write a post, view the posts in order and update the written post. There is also the feature of searching among the written articles by title and username. Finally, there is information about me in the About section.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as a Node.js application utilizing the following key technologies:

- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and middleware.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templates for rendering dynamic content on the client side.

The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase. Users can navigate the site, read blog posts, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own posts.
